## 📌 About the Project

**Path AI** is an AI-powered web tool designed to predict student **academic performance** and monitor **behavioral patterns** by analyzing:

- 📊 Continuous Assessment (CA) marks  
- 📈 Pre-Continuous Assessment (PCA) marks  
- 📅 Attendance records  
- 🧍‍♂️ **Overall student behavior**

It features **two prediction systems**:
- 🧮 One based on **predefined mathematical logic built in JavaScript**
- 🧠 Another powered by **Deep Learning models** for more dynamic, data-driven predictions

Together, they offer both **rule-based** and **intelligent** analysis of academic trends and student outcomes.

Path AI also integrates **dual chatbot systems**:

- 🎓 **Academic Chatbot** – Built using **Skit** and **Gemini API**, this bot helps students resolve academic doubts, provide subject-related guidance, and streamline access to information  
- 🧠 **Mental Health Chatbot** – Supports emotional well-being using **emotion detection**, powered by the **FER (Facial Expression Recognition)** library

> 💡 *Our vision is to empower students and educators with proactive tools that combine academic intelligence with emotional care.*
